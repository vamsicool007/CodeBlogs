# CodeBlogs
This is a blogging website where the coders can write their blogs and share their knowledge. The framework used in this project is python flask in the backend and sqlalchemy to connect to database.


### Front End:

  -	HTML: This is used to create the webpages and making those labels and text fields, headings etc. 
  
  -	CSS: This is used to make the webpages look good like adjusting the font, colour and images alignment etc. 


### Back End:

  -	Flask: This is a web-application framework which is written in python. This is used especially for web applications which includes certain libraries which will help us           develop a web application more easily without doing the groundwork.
  
  -	SQLAlchemy: This is an SQL toolkit which is more compatible with python language and the database used in this project is written with SQLAlchemy.


### How to run (For Windows):

  1.	Install python in your OS by downloading the latest version available on python.org.
  
  2.	Install these packages through cmd:
        -	pip install wtforms
        -	pip install flask
        -	pip install flask_sqlalchemy
        -	pip install flask_login
        -	pip install flask_bcrypt

        -	pip install email_validator
        -	pip install secret
        -	pip install pillow
        
  3.	Then go the directory of the project and open cmd in that folder or open cmd change directory to project folder.
  
  4.	Now write this command: python run.py
  
  5.	Then you will observe an ip address copy that and paste it in any browser and you can see the website there.
